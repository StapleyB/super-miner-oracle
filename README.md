Determine your future Super Miners!

Warning: use of this tool may instill anguish. The knowledge contained within cannot be unlearned.

## About

This tool is designed to inform players of the game Mr. Mine as to their future Ethereal Chest rewards. Since the game puts the chest reward seed in the save to prevent save-scumming, this allows for anybody who knows the rng function to calculate what any future reward will be. This tool finds valuable rewards.

A consequence of this is that a player may find that they will have to open several thousands of chests in order to obtain a valuable Thoth the Wise. Some people may find this knowledge makes their gameplay unfun.

## Testing

Included in the file `testsaves.txt` are a couple example saves if you just want to see how the tool works.

## Changelog

### v0.1

Initial Release. Support for upcoming legendaries and next Rare or Legendary arbitrary Super Miner.

In the future, I'd like to add calculating whether or not you can obtain enough eggs to get 4 before a certain chest threshold. (Though working around slots sounds like a pain)
